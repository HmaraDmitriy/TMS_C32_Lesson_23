Working with JSON file, JAXB and XML, parser (DOM, SAX, StAX)


1. Using the Jackson library, write a Java program that parses a JSON file (books.json) and saves the data to a Java collection.
2. Convert the data from this collection to XML format using the JAXB library. Save the resulting XML result to a file.
3. Using any parser (DOM, SAX, StAX), parse the data in a Java application and output information about the book with the largest number of pages to the console.
